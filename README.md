# Overview
For your second CA, you are required to build an Interactive Portfolio Website using Bootstrap. 

## Portfolio Website

Design & develop a webpage showcasing your talents and achievements. This website must be developed using Twitter Bootstrap as a base. Think of the page as your online CV, which you will show potential employers in the future. 
The following requirements should give you a broad outline of what to include on your website. This is by no means a comprehensive list as you are expected to add your own style, creativity, and implementation of guidelines, that you have learned during our User Experience lectures. 
- All details must be true
- A hero component at the top of the page should include a photo and details such as your name & discipline etc.
- Include education details and module grades.
- Include any 2nd, 3rd & 4th year project details.
- Include work placement details where appropriate
- FLITE students may use their previous work experience.
- A section on the type of work or project that you are interested in
- One section on your hobbies/interests at the end of the page is best.
- Theme and style the page in a professional (employable) way.
- A button which opens a modal dialog with contact information for you. You can also provide a more detailed contact section too.
- Contain no material that could be deemed defamatory, offensive or in poor taste regarding yourself, your fellow students, the institute, or anyone else
- Most of the content will be static. However, you should introduce dynamic content using JavaScript. This is separate from any Bootstrap functionality. This will be discussed further in class as well as the CA in general.
- Your website should be hosted on Azure, GitHub, or similar platform.

## Your CA will be marked on several criteria, including:

-	Does it fulfil the criteria established above?
-	Have you added functionality beyond the minimum that is required?
-	Does it implement many of Bootstrap's features to support a greater interactive and enjoyable experience for your user?
-	Have you built your interface around a user centric design? Have you considered the User Experience in your layout and design?
-	Does it give a good impression of you and your achievements?
-	Have you applied the theory discussed in class to your design?
-	Is your interface usable & legible on mobile, tablet and desktop devices?
-	Design, functionality, complexity, and completeness.
